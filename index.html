						<p>Data-driven services and devices have profound consequences for how we think of ourselves, relate to one other, organize collective life, and envision desirable futures. UC Berkeley's Human Contexts and Ethics of Data course prepares students to use the tools of applied historical thinking and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) to engage as knowledgeable, skillful, and responsible citizens and professionals in the varied arenas of our datafied world. </p>

						<p>The course meets the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of UC Berkeley's Data Science major. It gives Data Science majors systematic exposure and reflective practice in the human choices and social structures that intrinsically shape their work as data scientists. For students who do not intend to major in Data Science, the course will jumpstart your knowledge and strengthen your capacity to take part in guiding our datafied world. </p>

						<p>The course carries the broad, inclusive spirit of Berkeley’s Data Science curriculum into the area of human society and collective choices. It is offered in partnership with the Berkeley Division of Data Sciences. </p>

							Henry Schmidt is a second year doctoral student in the History Department. He specializes in the history of science, with past work touching on links between early modern mathematics and method, pan-European meteorology between the world wars, and affinities between Victorian chemistry and political economy. He grew up in Saint Louis, Missouri, and then attended Williams College, where he studied the History of Art and English Literature. After graduation, he studied at the University of Cambridge for two years on a Dr. Herchel Smith Fellowship, taking MPhils in Early Modern History and the History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science, Technology, and Medicine. Before coming to Berkeley, he briefly lived and worked in Italy and Ecuador.

							Ari S. Edmundson is currently finishing his PhD in the Department of History at UC Berkeley in the field of Late Modern European Intellectual History. His dissertation, “A Selective Affinity: Contingency and the Will to System in the Early Niklas Luhmann, 1958-1973,” charts the rise of contingency semantics in postwar West German philosophy and social theory by focusing on their development within the systems theory of sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998). He is broadly interested in using alternative forms of critical social theory to reconceptualize and address the problems associated with the contemporary “datafied world.” In addition to teaching the pilot program version of “Human Contexts and Ethics of Data Science” as a GSI in the Spring of 2018, he has helped refine and develop HCE course content and pedagogy.
