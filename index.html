						<p>Data-driven services and devices have profound consequences for how we think of ourselves, relate to one other, organize collective life, and envision desirable futures. UC Berkeley's Human Contexts and Ethics of Data course prepares students to use the tools of applied historical thinking and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) to engage as knowledgeable, skillful, and responsible citizens and professionals in the varied arenas of our datafied world. </p>

						<p>The course meets the Human Contexts and Ethics requirement of UC Berkeley's Data Science major. It gives Data Science majors systematic exposure and reflective practice in the human choices and social structures that intrinsically shape their work as data scientists. For students who do not intend to major in Data Science, the course will jumpstart your knowledge and strengthen your capacity to take part in guiding our datafied world. </p>

						<p>The course carries the broad, inclusive spirit of Berkeley’s Data Science curriculum into the area of human society and collective choices. It is offered in partnership with the Berkeley Division of Data Sciences. </p>

This  year in the Division she is working on developing Berkeley’s research and teaching programs in the Human Contexts and Ethics of data science. She works on the history and philosophy of modern science and technology, especially modern physics and computing. Before receiving her PhD in History of Science from Harvard, she was trained in computational condensed matter physics.

							includes translating social science theory and methods for a general education audience,
							building connections between engineering and social sciences, bringing together faculty,
							graduate students, and undergraduates at Berkeley into a community of scholars focused on
							HCE issues, and connecting the work of HCE to Bay Area&#39;s communities and needs. She is
							trained in the field of Science, Technology and Society (STS) and holds a PhD in HIstory of
							Science (Harvard University) and in Philosophy (Université Paris-Sorbonne). Her research
							examines transformations to human identity, ethics, and citizenship in relation to information
							technologies from historical and cross-cultural perspectives.

							Henry Schmidt is a second year doctoral student in the History Department. He specializes in the history of science, with past work touching on links between early modern mathematics and method, pan-European meteorology between the world wars, and affinities between Victorian chemistry and political economy. He grew up in Saint Louis, Missouri, and then attended Williams College, where he studied the History of Art and English Literature. After graduation, he studied at the University of Cambridge for two years on a Dr. Herchel Smith Fellowship, taking MPhils in Early Modern History and the History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science, Technology, and Medicine. Before coming to Berkeley, he briefly lived and worked in Italy and Ecuador.

							Ari S. Edmundson is currently finishing his PhD in the Department of History at UC Berkeley in the field of Late Modern European Intellectual History. His dissertation, “A Selective Affinity: Contingency and the Will to System in the Early Niklas Luhmann, 1958-1973,” charts the rise of contingency semantics in postwar West German philosophy and social theory by focusing on their development within the systems theory of sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998). He is broadly interested in using alternative forms of critical social theory to reconceptualize and address the problems associated with the contemporary “datafied world.” In addition to teaching the pilot program version of “Human Contexts and Ethics of Data Science” as a GSI in the Spring of 2018, he has helped refine and develop HCE course content and pedagogy.

							Bailey Farren is a fifth-year undergraduate senior majoring in Rhetoric and Cognitive Science. Her research interests rest at the intersection of ethical and technological discourses in and beyond academia. Years working with and around startups—specifically in data analytics and data-driven business models—have compelled her to participate in the types of conversations fostered by HCE, where she now plays a roll in the course administration and communication. She works directly with Margo Boenig-Liptsin and Cathryn Carson in the development of the course as well as the community and conversations around it.
